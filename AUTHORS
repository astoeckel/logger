Here is an inevitably incomplete list of MUCH-APPRECIATED CONTRIBUTORS --
people who have submitted patches, reported bugs, added translations, helped
answer newbie questions, and generally made Vmodule that much better:

    Bernhard Vogginger
    Christoph Koke <christoph.koke@kip.uni-heidelberg.de>
    Daniel Bruederle
    Eric Müller <mueller@kip.uni-heidelberg.de>
    Thomas Pfeil <tpfeil@kip.uni-heidelberg.de>
